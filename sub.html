<p>Marvel Studios, LLC[4] (originally known as Marvel Films from 1993 to 1996) is an American film and television studio that is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios. Marvel Studios is known for the production of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics publications.[5]

    Marvel Studios has released 23 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from Iron Man (2008) to Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). These films all share continuity with each other, along with the One-Shots produced by the studio and the television shows produced by Marvel Television.
    
    In addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios was also involved with the production of other Marvel-character film franchises that have exceeded $1 billion in North American box office revenue: the X-Men and Spider-Man multi-film franchises.
    
    Marvel Studios is also developing television series which will air on Disney+, and will oversee production for remaining Marvel Television series following its folding into Marvel Studios.</p>
